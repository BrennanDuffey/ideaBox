# ideaBox

## Description

This project is a simple static one page site which allows users to create a card with a title, body and quality. The user can then update the quality with the buttons on the appended card to the DOM. There is no backend so all ideas as saved to local storage and then pulled from there on refresh. This was a group project created in 11 days.
