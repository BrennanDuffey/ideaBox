## General Info

A project creating a UI from a flat image using HTML, CSS, and JS for Turing's Front-End Mod 1 program.

## Motivation

IdeaBox Triples was a project assigned to a group of three in Mod 1 at Turing.  We were given a flat image with styling details (e.g. hex codes) to reproduce from scratch in code.  This project consisted working partly with HTML and CSS, but primarily with JS.  This is the original design in desktop and mobile formats:
