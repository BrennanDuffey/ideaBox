## General Info

A project creating a UI from a flat image using HTML, CSS, and JS for Turing's Front-End Mod 1 program.

## Motivation

IdeaBox Triples was a project assigned to a group of three in Mod 1 at Turing.  We were given a flat image with styling details (e.g. hex codes) to reproduce from scratch in code.  This project consisted working partly with HTML and CSS, but primarily with JS.  This is the original design in desktop and mobile formats:

## Features

* UI built according to project guidelines
– Responsive for all screen sizes

- Save in local storage and cards persist on reload 
- Edit content after idea card has been created
– Edit quality of each created card to one of three options
- Delete card upon hitting X button
- Search for content in real time while typing in the search box
– UI shows the 10 most recent cards by default. Clicking "Show more" will display all cards; "Show less" - back to default.

## How to Use

1) Enter values into the Title and Body form. Upon clicking "Save", a card should appear below with the entered values displayed.
2) Clicking on the title or body of the card will give the ability to edit the values.
3) Clicking on the up and down arrows will reassign the quality value of the card to Genius, Plausible and Swill.
4) Clicking the X button will delete the card.
5) If there are more than 10 cards, only the 10 most recent cards are displayed. By pressing the "Show more" button, all cards can be viewed. Then by pressing "Show less," it again shows the 10 most recent cards.
6) Typing in the search box will display results in real time.
7) Upon reloading page, all current idea cards will persist and be displayed.
